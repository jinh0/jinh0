## Hi there, I'm Jinho 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working [@DDMAL](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca) on [Neon](https://github.com/DDMAL/Neon), an online medieval music editor.
- ⚙️ In my free time, I work on [an automated theorem prover](https://github.com/jinh0/atp) in **OCaml** and **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about functional programming with OCaml.
- 👀 If you're a Neovim user, you should check out my new plugin, [eyeliner.nvim](https://github.com/jinh0/eyeliner.nvim).
- 💬 Ask me about psychoanalysis, phenomenology, or philosophy of language!
